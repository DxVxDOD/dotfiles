### Fonts

	# Font to use, either a path to a font file or a name.
	#

	# characters not in the chosen font will fail to render.

	# Otherwise, fonts are interpreted in Pango format.

### Text layout

### Window theming

### Window positioning

	# Set the size of the exclusive zone.
	#
	# A value of -1 means ignore exclusive zones completely.
	# A value of 0 will move tofi out of the way of other windows' zones.
	# A value greater than 0 will set that much space as an exclusive zone.
	#
	# Values greater than 0 are only meaningful when tofi is anchored to a
	# single edge.
